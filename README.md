Example 1: Python Programming Tutorial
Input (Transcript Excerpt):
"Welcome to Python programming! In this session, we’ll cover the basics of variables, data types, loops, and functions..."

Output (Markdown):

## Python Programming Basics

### Key Topics:

1. Variables and Data Types:
   - Variables store data values.
   - Common types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), strings (`str`), etc.
2. Loops:
   - `for` loops iterate over sequences.
   - `while` loops run until a condition is false.
3. Functions:
   - Reusable blocks of code defined using `def`.

Example 2: Machine Learning Lecture
Input (Transcript Excerpt):
"In today’s lecture, we’ll discuss supervised learning algorithms like linear regression and classification techniques..."

Output (Markdown):

## Machine Learning Overview

### Core Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Linear Regression: Predicts continuous outcomes.
   - Classification: Categorizes data into predefined labels.
2. Key Techniques:
   - Gradient Descent for optimization.
   - Cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Example 3: Business Meeting Recap
Input (Transcript Excerpt):
"During the meeting, we discussed project timelines, resource allocation, and upcoming deadlines..."

Output (Markdown):

## Meeting Summary

### Key Points:

1. Project Timelines:
